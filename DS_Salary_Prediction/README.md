This is an educational project I made to practice the machine learning project steps.


# Project Overview
- Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
- Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
- Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
- Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.

# Code and Resources Used:

**Python Version:** 3.8

**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, selenium

# Web Scraping
Tweaked the web scraper github repo (above) to scrape 1000 job postings from glassdoor.com. With each job, we got the following:

- Job title
- Salary Estimate
- Job Description
- Rating
- Company
- Location
- Company Headquarters
- Company Size
- Company Founded Date
- Type of Ownership
- Industry
- Sector
- Revenue
- Competitors

# Data Cleaning
After scraping the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes and created the following variables:

- Parsed numeric data out of salary
- Made columns for employer provided salary and hourly wages
- Removed rows without salary
- Parsed rating out of company text
- Made a new column for company state
- Added a column for if the job was at the companyâ€™s headquarters
- Transformed founded date into age of company
- Made columns for if different skills were listed in the job description:
    - Python
    - R
    - Excel
    - AWS
    - Spark
    - Column for simplified job title and Seniority
    - Column for description length

# EDA
I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various categorical variables. Below are a few highlights from the pivot tables.
